# Super Mario Number Generator in Assembly 8086

This repository contains an implementation of a Super Mario Number Generator in Assembly language (8086 architecture). The Super Mario Number Generator aims to demystify the seemingly random appearance of monsters and objects in a Super Mario stage by revealing the underlying algorithm used for their placement. Contrary to popular belief, the placement of monsters and objects in Super Mario stages follows a predetermined pattern, which can be decoded using this number generator.

## Description

In the Super Mario series, players navigate through various stages filled with monsters, obstacles, and items. While the placement of monsters and objects may appear random to players, it is actually determined by a complex algorithm that takes into account factors such as level design, player progression, and game difficulty.

The Super Mario Number Generator in Assembly 8086 works by reverse-engineering the algorithm used for generating the placement of monsters and objects in a Super Mario stage. By analyzing the game's code and memory structures, the generator identifies the sequence of numbers used as input to the placement algorithm. These numbers represent parameters such as enemy types, spawn locations, and item distributions.

Once the number sequence is decoded, the generator can predict the placement of monsters and objects in a Super Mario stage with a high degree of accuracy. This insight into the underlying pattern allows players to anticipate enemy encounters, plan their movements strategically, and optimize their gameplay experience.

## Features

### 1. Number Generation

The Super Mario Number Generator generates a sequence of numbers that serve as input to the placement algorithm used in Super Mario stages. These numbers represent parameters such as enemy types, spawn locations, and item distributions.

### 2. Prediction

Based on the generated number sequence, the generator predicts the placement of monsters and objects in a Super Mario stage. By analyzing the sequence, players can anticipate enemy encounters, identify item locations, and strategize their approach to completing the stage.

### 3. Visualization (Optional)

Optionally, the generator can provide visualizations of the predicted placement of monsters and objects in a Super Mario stage. These visualizations may include diagrams, maps, or simulated gameplay scenarios to help players understand the predicted patterns and make informed decisions during gameplay.

## Usage

To use the Super Mario Number Generator implemented in Assembly 8086, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Assemble and run the Assembly program using an 8086 emulator or assembler.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate a sequence of numbers representing the placement parameters for a Super Mario stage.

4. Analyze the generated number sequence to predict the placement of monsters and objects in the stage.

5. Use the insights gained from the generator to strategize your gameplay and navigate through the Super Mario stage more effectively.
